# Explanation of File.rs 
[Source Code](../src/file.rs)
## read_all

```rust
pub fn read_all(fd: RawFd, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize>
```

This function reads all data from a file into a buffer.

1. `let mut file = unsafe { File::from_raw_fd(fd) };` - This line creates a new `File` object from a raw file descriptor. This operation is unsafe because it's not guaranteed that the file descriptor is valid or that it hasn't been used elsewhere.

2. `let metadata = file.metadata()?;` - This line retrieves the metadata of the file, which includes information like the file size.

3. `if metadata.len() == 0 || buf.is_empty() {...}` - This checks if the file is empty or if the buffer is empty. If either is true, it prints a message and returns early with `Ok(0)`.

4. `file.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0))?;` - This line moves the file's cursor to the start of the file.

5. `while pos < buf.len() {...}` - This loop reads the file into the buffer in chunks until the buffer is full or the end of the file is reached.

## write_all

```rust
pub fn write_all(mut file: &File, buf: &[u8]) -> io::Result<usize>
```

This function writes all data from a buffer into a file.

1. `file.write_all(buf)?;` - This line writes the entire buffer into the file. If an error occurs during this operation, it will be returned immediately.

2. `Ok(buf.len())` - This line returns the number of bytes that were intended to be written.

## mmap_file

```rust
pub unsafe fn mmap_file(filename: &Path) -> Result<(Mmap, usize), std::io::Error>
```

This function memory-maps a file.

1. `let file = File::open(filename)?;` - This line opens the file.

2. `let metadata = file.metadata()?;` - This line retrieves the metadata of the file.

3. `if file_size > 0 {...}` - This checks if the file is not empty. If it is, it returns an error.

4. `let mmap = MmapOptions::new().map(&file)?;` - This line creates a new memory map of the file.

## buffer_for_each_line

```rust
pub fn buffer_for_each_line<F>(buf: &[u8], mut cb: F)
where
    F: FnMut(&str) -> bool,
```

This function processes a buffer line by line in forward order.

1. `while pos < size {...}` - This loop iterates over each line in the buffer.

2. `if(cb(std::str::from_utf8(line).unwrap())) {...}` - This line calls the callback function with each line. If the callback function returns `true`, it breaks the loop.

## buffer_for_each_line_reverse

```rust
pub fn buffer_for_each_line_reverse<F>(buf: &[u8], mut cb: F)
where
    F: FnMut(&str) -> bool,
```

This function is similar to `buffer_for_each_line`, but it processes the buffer in reverse order.

## file_for_each_line

```rust
pub fn file_for_each_line<F>(filename: &str, mut cb: F) -> io::Result<()>
where
    F: FnMut(&str) -> io::Result<()>,
```

This function processes a file line by line.

1. `let file = File::open(&Path::new(filename))?;` - This line opens the file.

2. `let reader = io::BufReader::new(file);` - This line creates a new buffered reader for the file.

3. `for line in reader.lines() {...}` - This loop iterates over each line in the file and calls the callback function with each line. If the callback function returns an error, it will be propagated.
